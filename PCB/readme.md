# PCB files for Autodesk Fusion

These files includes:
- Libraries for different components created for the design
- Schematic design (connections)
- PCB design (properly)
- PCB project (includes everything to edit the design)

Missing connections is due to the limitations of working on a single layer project. They were done by hand.
