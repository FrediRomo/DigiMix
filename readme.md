# DigiMix

A Digial Audio Mixer in a stagebox format with wireless UI based on an STM32H7, ESP32C6 and Altera DE-1 SoC FPGA


## Overview
DigiMix project features all the sourcecode for its creation. Sections are divided by microcontroller type -> ESP32 & STM32.
With this project we aim to enhance and combine the best of both worlds (Audio Mixer with an StageBox format) and use the power of
IoT to remotely connect and modify our filters, etc. to get the desired audio output.
