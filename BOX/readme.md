# Box design for audio mixer

Inside this directory we designed the audio mixer box to fit all the components, including the PCB. You could find
- Solidworks project files in case you need to edit them
- STL files as a more universal file

The box is designed to fit the following components:
- 1x XLR input for chassis
- 3x 1/4" jack for chassis
- 1x Power switch
- 1x DC 2.1 barrel jack
- 2x 3.5 mm jack for chassis
- 1x Motorized fader COM-10976
- Custom PCB

If you want to recreate this project, you will need the following screws:
- 4x M3 20 mm screws to join up the lid with the box
- 4x M3 6/8 mm screws to assemble the PCB to the lid
- 2x M3 6/8 mm screws to screw the fader to the box
- 2x M3 6/8 mm screws to connect the XLR jack to the box
